## UE5-VR & Serial Communication

### · Introduction：
#### In the VR scene, the player character can walk in the specified scene and control the servo rotation.

### · Research:
#### The resources found at first were found to be unable to match the 5.03 of ue5, and finally the latest updated plug-in specifications were found.
