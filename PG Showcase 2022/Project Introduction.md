### An immersive artistic concept work that combines VR games and art installations. Through the contradiction between the audience’s immersive experience in the VR game world and the physical operation of the external mechanical device, while promoting the communication of the project concept, it tries to break the limitation of the original experience of VR public installations and enhance the participation of the audience. The project is visually divided into two parts: a VR game scene and external equipment. Their combination attempts to convey the concept of the work to the audience: with the development of technology, machines may become more and more difficult to control, and even humans will be controlled by machines, further causing the audience to reflect.

### The VR game is divided into three different scenes. They respectively showed the beginning of life, the development of technology, and the machine surpasses human beings.
