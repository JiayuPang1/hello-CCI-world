## Project introduction:
#### With the increasing impact of technology on human society and the world, the relationship between human, technology and nature has become a hot topic today.
#### The work attempts to process images and sound through art and machine learning. And display it in a virtual game space.
#### The ending of the game is open, there is no end, and the audience can explore freely in the game space. While giving the audience a multi-sensory immersive experience, it also makes people reflect on the possibility of how to escape from reincarnation.

#### The first space is return to nothing, more like a spiritual world.

#### The second space shows the blurring of the boundaries between man and machine as technology develops.  There is pressure from the building throughout the space.

#### The third space symbolizes the beginning of life and symbolizes hope.  As if everything could be done all over again.  In fact, we have indeed set a trigger point in the space to return to the beginning, which requires the audience to explore on their own.
